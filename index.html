        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <hr>
        <h4>HTML, or <strong><i>HyperText Markup Language</i></strong>, is the standard language used to create and design webpages. It structures web content by defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other multimedia. HTML uses tags, such as `< html >`, `< head >`, `< body >`, and others, to encapsulate these elements, providing a framework for web browsers to interpret and display content correctly. HTML is fundamental to web development, working alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. It is constantly evolving, with HTML5 being the latest version, introducing new features for improved web functionality and multimedia support.</h4>
        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <hr>
        <h4>CSS, or <strong><i>Cascading Style Sheets</i></strong>, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of web pages, enabling developers to separate content from design. CSS allows for responsive design, ensuring websites look good on various devices. By using selectors and properties, developers can apply styles to elements, classes, or IDs. CSS also supports animations and transitions, enhancing user experience. Its cascading nature means styles can be inherited or overridden, providing flexibility and control over the website's look and feel.</h4>
